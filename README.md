## Publishing of Artifacts to NPM, Github release section and CDN sites is pending but source code is complete

Highly customizable [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) plugin that displays labels outside the pie/doughnut chart.

Requires [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases) **3.0.0** or later.

*This is originally a fork of https://github.com/Neckster/chartjs-plugin-piechart-outlabels with support for Chart.js 3 and latest version of Chart.js 4. Also leveraged https://github.com/gagiD/chartjs-plugin-outlabels4 in order to port the code to Typescript, and to move away from the build dependency on Gulp.*
